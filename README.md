## Boston housing price prediction using desicsion tree.
### Predicting housing price by learnign the followings:
#### Explore data and observe features
#### Explore goodness of fit using coefficient of determination, R^2(``r2_score`` from ``sklearn.metrics``)
#### Divide data set into training and test set using ``train_test_split`` from ``sklearn.cross_validation``.
#### Analyze model performance with the followings:
##### Learning curve
##### Complexity curve
#### Explore bias and variance tradeoff by understanding of underfitting and overfitting
#### Evaluate model performance:
##### Grid seach and cross Validataion using ``DecisionTreeRegressor``, ``GridSearchCV`` from ``sklearn.grid_search``.
##### Fitting a model
##### Make predictions
